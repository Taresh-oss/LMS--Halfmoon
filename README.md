# LMS--Halfmoon
In this repository I have implemented LMS algorithm from scratch in halfmoon dataset which is being created in the code itself.
Halfmoon data is formed keep its parameters values as
- features=3 (number of attributes +label column)
- instances=3000 
- r=10 (radius =10)
- d=0 (distance between two half moon =0)
- w=4 (width =4)

I have added the pdf to see the results which came out to be 97.05% while testing.
